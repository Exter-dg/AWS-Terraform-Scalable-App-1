# Title: Deploying a Scalable Web Service Infrastructure on AWS using Terraform

**Objective:**
To provision a fault-tolerant and scalable web service environment on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). The environment should be accessible via a public endpoint and automatically manage its compute capacity.

## Overall Steps & Key Areas to Focus On:

### Network Foundation Design (Your VPC Blueprint)
* Define and create a custom **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**.
* Strategically design and implement your **subnetting scheme**:
    * Consider **public subnets** for internet-facing resources (like your load balancer).
    * Consider **private subnets** for your application servers for enhanced security.
    * Ensure internet connectivity for your public subnets (think **Internet Gateway** and **routing**).
* *(Self-exploration point: How will instances in private subnets access the internet for updates if needed? Research NAT Gateway/Instance options and their Free Tier implications, or decide if your application instances need outbound internet for this project.)*

### Security Implementation (Your Digital Bouncers)
* Define **security groups** to act as virtual firewalls.
* Create distinct rules for your load balancer (what can talk to it?) and your application instances (who can they receive traffic from, e.g., only the load balancer?).

### Application Instance Configuration (The Workers)
* Choose a suitable **EC2 instance type** (keep the AWS Free Tier in mind).
* Prepare a **launch configuration** or **launch template**.
* Automate the setup of a basic web server on your instances using **user data scripts** (e.g., install Apache/Nginx and deploy a simple HTML page).

### Load Balancing Setup (The Traffic Manager)
* Implement an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
* Configure it to distribute traffic across instances in your public subnets.
* Set up **target groups** and **listeners** to correctly route traffic to your application instances.
* Implement **health checks** to ensure traffic only goes to healthy instances.

### Auto Scaling Implementation (The Elasticity Engine)
* Create an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** linked to your launch template/configuration and target group.
* Define **scaling parameters** (min, max, desired capacity) to allow your application to handle varying loads and recover from instance failures.
* Ensure the ASG launches instances across multiple **Availability Zones** for high availability.

### Outputs & Verification (The Proof of Work)
* Ensure your Terraform configuration outputs key information, especially the **DNS name of your load balancer**.
* Verify that you can access your web application through the load balancer's DNS name.
* Test the setup (e.g., terminate an instance to see the ASG launch a new one).

## Tips for Your Exploration:

* **Iterate:** Don't try to write all the Terraform code at once. Build and test each component (VPC, then SGs, then EC2, etc.).
* **AWS Documentation & Terraform Registry:** These are your best friends. Refer to them often for resource attributes and examples.
* `terraform plan`: Use this extensively to see what changes Terraform will make before applying them.
* **Modularity (Consider for bonus points or future growth):** Think about how you could structure your Terraform code into reusable modules.
* **Clean Up:** Remember `terraform destroy` when you are done for the day/week to avoid unexpected AWS costs beyond the free tier.
